You built a Kubernetes-native Application? Here is how OpenShift helps you to run, develop, build and deliver it - securely!

1. Run: Get your Angular, Python or Java Dockerfile ready with Red Hat's Universal Base Image and deploy with Helm on OpenShift
2. Develop: The Inner Loop with OpenShift Dev Spaces
3. Build: From upstream Tekton and ArgoCD to OpenShift Pipelines and GitOps
4. Deliver: Publish your own Operator with Operator Lifecycle Manager and the OpenShift Operator Catalog
